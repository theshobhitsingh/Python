# 🐍 My Python Notes

This repo is where I’m keeping everything I’ve learned in Python.

I wanted a place to organize all the topics I’ve studied — with clean code, examples, and some explanations written for myself. No tutorials, no copy-paste. Just what *I* understand, in the way *I* understand it.

## 🗂 What’s Inside

This is the structure I’m following (roughly in the order I learned it):

| Folder                 | What it covers |
|------------------------|----------------|
| `01_foundations/`      | The absolute basics — print, variables, comments, syntax. |
| `02_data_types/`       | Strings, lists, dicts, sets, tuples — all the built-in types. |
| `03_operators/`        | Arithmetic, logical, comparison, bitwise, etc. |
| `04_conditionals/`     | `if`, `elif`, `else` and how branching works. |
| `05_loops/`            | `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, loop patterns. |
| `06_iteration_tools/`  | Stuff like `range()`, `enumerate()`, `zip()`. |
| `07_functions/`        | Defining functions, parameters, return values, lambdas. |
| `08_scope/`            | Local vs global variables, `nonlocal`, and how scope works. |
| `09_decorators/`       | Custom decorators and how they actually work. |
| `10_oops/`             | Classes, inheritance, and writing code like real programs. |
| `11_file_handling/`    | Reading/writing files, `with` statements, binary files. |
| `12_exception_handling/` | `try`, `except`, raising and catching errors. |

I’ll keep updating it as I learn more.

## ❗ Why This Exists

I learn best by writing and organizing code *my way*.  
This repo isn’t meant to teach anyone — it’s just my personal notebook in code form.  
I’m not trying to be fancy or follow textbook rules — just writing what makes sense to me.

## 🔧 Stuff I Might Add Later

- A few mini projects
- Notes on modules and packages
- Some simple scripts for practice
- Web stuff, maybe (if I go that route)

That’s it.
